## Description

Never Alone is an application built with mental health in mind where users can post how they are feeling and have feedback from other users. Once a user has signed up or logged in, they are taken to the homepage where they can see the motivational quote of the day, make their own posts, and see posts that others have made. Users can interact with other posts by leaving comments on posts to motivate and provide support to anyone having a hard time.
